\section*{Introduction}
While searching for a way to newly prove the Pythagorean Theorem, we have both decided to try to find a new way to prove it using this diagram. Then we came up with this idea.
\section*{Overview}
Heron's formula, proven by Heron in the first century, tells us how to calculate the area of a triangle using only three sides of it. Although the most famous proofs of this formula uses the Pythagorean Theorem to prove it, there are proofs, such as a proof from Professor Paul Yiu \footnote[1]{http://users.math.uoc.gr/~pamfilos/Yiu.pdf} which makes this formula able to use without causing circular reasoning.


We had proven the Pythagorean Theorem using Heron's formula and properties of a triangle inscribed in a semicircle. The proof is divided into two exhaustive cases: \( a \neq b \) and \( a = b \), with \( a, b > 0 \) and \( c \) as hypotenuse. However, after finishing our initial report and submitting it(to the public), we have found numerous errors in our report. Thus, we have written a revised version of the proof.

\section*{Case I: \( a \neq b \)}

Let the triangle \( ABC \) be a circle inscribed so that \( \overline{BC} \) is the diameter. Let \( O \) be the center of the circle. Draw lines \( \overline{AO} \), dividing \( \triangle ABC \) into triangles \( \triangle ABO \) and \( \triangle AOC \)

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=1.2]
  % Define points
  \coordinate (B) at (-2,0);
  \coordinate (C) at (2,0);
  \coordinate (O) at (0,0);
  \coordinate (A) at ({sqrt(2)},{sqrt(2)});
  (semicircle)

  % Draw semicircle
  \draw[thick] (B) arc[start angle=180, end angle=0, radius=2];

  % Draw triangle
  \draw[thick] (B) -- (A) -- (C);
  \draw[dashed] (A) -- (O); % Segment AO
  % diameter
   \draw [thick ] (B) -- (O) -- (C);
  % Mark points
  \fill (A) circle;
  \fill (B) circle;
  \fill (C) circle;
  \fill (O) circle;

  % Labels
  \node[above] at (A) {$A$};
  \node[below left] at (B) {$B$};
  \node[below right] at (C) {$C$};
  \node[below] at (O) {$O$};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}




\subsection*{Using Heron's Formula}

Let \( a = AB \), \( b = AC \), and \( c = BC \). Let \( p \) be the semi-perimeter of triangle \( ABO \), i.e.:
\[
p = \frac{a + c}{2}
\]
Then Heron's formula gives the area of triangle \( ABO \) as:
\[
\Delta_{ABO} = \sqrt{p(p - a)(p - c)(p - a)} = \sqrt{\frac{b^2(c - b)}{16}}
\]
Similarly, for triangle \( AOC \):
\[
\Delta_{AOC} = \sqrt{\frac{a^2(c - a)}{16}}
\]

Since triangle AOC = triangle ABO, we get:
\[
\Delta_{ABO} = \Delta_{AOC}
\]

Squaring both sides and simplifying:
\[
\sqrt{\frac{b^2(c - b)}{16}} = \sqrt{\frac{a^2(c - a)}{16}} 
\]
After algebraic manipulation, this leads to the following.
\[
c^2 = a^2 + b^2
\]

\section*{Case II: \( a = b \)}

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=1.2]
  % Define points
  \coordinate (B) at (-2,0);
  \coordinate (C) at (2,0);
  \coordinate (O) at (0,0);
  \coordinate (A) at (0,2);
  (semicircle)

  % Draw semicircle
  \draw[thick] (B) arc[start angle=180, end angle=0, radius=2];

  % Draw triangle
  \draw[thick] (B) -- (A) -- (C);
  \draw[dashed] (A) -- (O); % Segment AO
  % diameter
   \draw [thick ] (B) -- (O) -- (C);
  % Mark points
  \fill (A) circle;
  \fill (B) circle;
  \fill (C) circle;
  \fill (O) circle;

  % Labels
  \node[above] at (A) {$A$};
  \node[below left] at (B) {$B$};
  \node[below right] at (C) {$C$};
  \node[below] at (O) {$O$};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

Assume \( \overline{AB} = \overline{AC} \), and again \( \overline{BC} \) is the diameter. Then the triangle \( ABC \) is isosceles and inscribed in a semicircle.

By Thales' Theorem, the angle \( \angle A \) is a right angle:
\[
\angle ABC = \angle ACB = 45^\circ \Rightarrow \angle BAC = 90^\circ
\]
And since \( \overline{AB} = \overline{AC}, \)
\[
a^2 = b^2
\]
Using trigonometry or basic geometry:
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot a \cdot b = \frac{1}{2} a^2
\]
And the area can also be found like this:
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2}\cdot \frac{c}{2}\cdot c  = \frac{1}{4}c^2
\]
Thus:
\[
c^2 = 2a^2
\]

\[
c^2 = a^2 + b^2
\]
\section*{Conclusion}

Dividing into the cases \( a = b \) and \( a \neq b \), we have shown that:
\[
c^2 = a^2 + b^2
\]
for all real numbers \( a, b > 0 \). This completes the proof of the Pythagorean Theorem.
