# A New Proof of the Pythagorean Theorem

This repository presents a new geometric proof of the **Pythagorean Theorem**, discovered using **Thales' Circle** and perpendicular constructions.

## Summary

In this proof, a right triangle is inscribed in a circle (using Thales' Theorem), and a perpendicular is dropped from the right-angle vertex to the hypotenuse. By analyzing the resulting similar triangles and using basic proportions, the Pythagorean identity \( a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \) is proven in a clean, elegant way.

The method appears to be a novel variation not listed among well-known collections of Pythagorean proofs.

## Background

This work was created by two high school students interested in geometry and classical mathematics. The goal was to explore new ways to understand the Pythagorean Theorem using circle geometry.

##  Why it's interesting

- A clean, geometric approach rooted in classical theorems
- An elegant use of Heron’s Formula
- A potentially new variation not found in common collections of Pythagorean proofs
